# Advent-of-code-2021
Advent of code 2021 tried by me in Python 3

My goal was to solve the tasks in the shortest possible time, not in the prettiest or most optimal way.

During Day 9, I decided that it was demanding too much of my time and stopped solving further tasks to concentrate on completing my master's thesis.
